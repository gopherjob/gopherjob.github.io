        <div class="desc"><p><strong>Senior Backend Engineer (Go, Kotlin, Java, C#) – High-Impact Role in SaaS Scaleup</strong></p>
<p>Help build the backbone of industrial traceability</p>
<p><strong>About ChainTraced</strong></p>
<p>ChainTraced provides a SaaS platform that makes it possible to share product data efficiently and securely across the entire value chain, from raw material all the way to end customer. Our customers are industrial companies that rely on metals in their production, and they use ChainTraced to streamline quality and sustainability data collection and to strengthen relationships with both suppliers and customers.</p>
<p>Regulations around CO₂ and traceability are increasing every year. That creates a very concrete need for what we build. ChainTraced is backed by strong industrial investors, has paying customers and a clear long term demand for the product. In practical terms, that means a stable role in a company with a bright future.</p>
<p>We are a small team based in central Stockholm. You work close to the code, close to the product and directly with the CTO. Decisions are made quickly and the distance from idea to production is short.</p>
<p><strong>Tech stack today</strong></p>
<p>Go</p>
<p>PostgreSQL</p>
<p>Redis</p>
<p>AWS</p>
<p>React with TypeScript</p>
<p>Extensive automated testing with a modern CI/CD pipeline</p>
<p><strong>The role</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for a Senior Backend Engineer who wants to own a large part of the backend and be a technical partner to the CTO. You will join a small, experienced team where your decisions have direct impact on architecture, performance and how the platform evolves over time.</p>
<p>The role is primarily backend focused. There is a React codebase in place, so the ability to read and maintain frontend code is helpful, but your main home will be Go, databases and cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>You get a permanent position with a safe base salary, qualified stock options and a very flexible way of working. The culture is based on freedom with responsibility, trust and close collaboration rather than heavy processes.</p>
<p><strong>What you will do</strong></p>
<p>• Design and implement backend code in Go together with the CTO</p>
<p>• Design and implement frontend functionality in React together with the CTO</p>
<p>• Work with PostgreSQL and Redis to model data, optimise queries and keep the system fast as volumes grow</p>
<p>• Take ownership of availability, scalability and performance in a cloud environment on AWS</p>
<p>• Improve and extend our CI/CD pipelines and automated tests</p>
<p>• Collaborate with customers and internal stakeholders when technical input is needed</p>
<p>• Help shape coding standards, architecture and ways of working in a small engineering team</p>
<p><strong>Who you are</strong></p>
<p>You enjoy working close to both product and infrastructure, and you are comfortable taking ownership in a small team. You like clear responsibility, but also the safety of a stable company with a long term mission.</p>
<p>We believe that you:</p>
<p>• Have several years of experience as a backend engineer in product companies or complex platforms</p>
<p>• Are strong in at least one statically typed language such as Go, Java, Kotlin, Rust or C# in modern cloud based environments</p>
<p>• Have solid experience with relational databases, preferably PostgreSQL</p>
<p>• Have worked with cloud platforms, ideally AWS, including infrastructure, monitoring and operations</p>
<p>• Are used to CI/CD and care about testing and safe releases</p>
<p>• Can collaborate closely with a CTO and enjoy being a sounding board on technical decisions</p>
<p>• Feel comfortable in English, both spoken and written</p>
<p>Experience from React or TypeScript is a plus, but not a requirement as long as you are willing to learn what is needed to maintain and improve the existing frontend.</p>
<p><strong>What ChainTraced offers</strong></p>
<p>• Permanent full time position in a company with clear product market fit and strong industrial investors</p>
<p>• Salary in the range of 55 000 to 65 000 SEK per month depending on experience</p>
<p>• Qualified stock option program that lets you share in the upside if the company grows as planned</p>
<p>• Very flexible way of working with a super hybrid setup, office in central Stockholm and high trust in remote work</p>
<p>• Flexible working hours that make it easier to combine work and life</p>
<p>• Thirty days of paid vacation</p>
<p>• Wellness allowance and the equipment you need to do a great job</p>
<p>• Breakfast and lunch available at the office on office days</p>
<p>• A key role close to the CTO where you influence architecture, stack and direction of the platform</p>
<p><strong>The process</strong></p>
<p>The recruitment process is designed to be straightforward and focused on mutual fit.</p>
<p>• Initial chat, about fifteen minutes, with the external recruiter to align expectations</p>
<p>• Technical discussion with the CTO, around forty five minutes, focusing on your experience and our current architecture</p>
<p>• Practical technical assessment, preferably as a pair programming session on site, where you lead the problem solving</p>
<p>• Final discussion about offer, terms and next steps</p>
<p><strong>Interested</strong></p>
