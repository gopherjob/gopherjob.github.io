        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div class="desc"><p><strong>Job Description</strong>
In today’s world, cybersecurity is an integral part of everyday life. Companies need to be prepared for anything; at any moment a threatening situation can arise. Together with your colleagues (currently 8 developers and testers), you build small projects in containers. Those projects together form the software solution on which ON2IT’s entire business runs. We mainly use PHP and Go, but it doesn’t actually matter which language you use. As long as it works and is simple. Keep it simple, fail fast.</p>
<p>And we have hefty demands of our own work quality, so we have CI and CD fully set up. Code styling is automatically checked and corrected, security checks are performed and of course our unit tests and functional tests (Cypress and Codeception) run before we roll out. You put your changes into production yourself after a code review and functional test.</p>
<p><strong>What You Tell Others You’re Doing</strong>
I build software that keeps our customers from getting hacked. Cybersecurity, yes, something with computers. No, that doesn’t mean I can fix your printer.</p>
<p><strong>What Will Your Work Week Look Like</strong>
As expected, you will mostly be writing code, which you will be doing from home and, at least 2 days a week, from our Zaltbommel office. We start the day with a (remote) stand up. There, we discuss the progress of the work. Do you need help? There are always colleagues ready to help you. The work consists of fixing bugs and implementing small feature requests or new projects. We record all these things in Gitlab. Sometime around noon, we have lunch together (unless you work from home of course) in our cozy canteen. Everything is completely taken care of; we just ask you to put away your plate in the dishwasher after. Every two weeks, we have a general team meeting and we do a retrospective as a team, that way we keep improving.</p>

<ul>
<li>You have excellent knowledge of PHP, Go, Java, Python or a similar language;</li>
<li>You have a completed IT degree or you have demonstrable college level of thinking and working;</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>What do we offer you?</strong>
We offer ample opportunity to continue to develop yourself by aiding you in furthering your education and encouraging you to follow training courses. A varied and well catered lunch will be available at the office every afternoon.</p>
